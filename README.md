# NOTICE: Project Discontinued 

As of early 2018, the container ecosystem is much more mature than it was three years ago when this project was initiated. Now, some of the critical and outstanding features of rocker can be easily covered by [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) or other well-supported tools, though some features do remain unique to rocker. See https://github.com/grammarly/rocker/issues/199 for more details.

Even though rocker is still widely used at Grammarly, we decided to discontinue its open source support as our team has different priorities now. We apologize to all active users for any inconvenience caused by the project shutdown. Also, sorry that some open issues have been left unanswered.

We hope that this project will serve an inspiration for other great initiatives in the community.

If you have anything critical, feel free to open an issue or email us.

See [original README.md](README.old.md).
